- Displays the current state of the word with underscores for unguessed letters.
- Tracks the number of attempts remaining for the player.
- Informs the player if a guessed letter is correct or incorrect.
- Ends the game when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts.
- Supports customization by allowing you to add more words to the text file.
